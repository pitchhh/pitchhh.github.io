After a relaxing yoga class, I passed by The Alchemist cafe and spontaneously picked up some Filter Espresso beans to experiment with. These beans, hailing from Guji in Ethiopia, promised a vibrant, citrusy, slightly acidic, and sweet experience, with tasting notes of bergamot, apricot, and blueberry.</p>

<p>The first time I got introduced to my new brewing toys was in Casablanca, during my Morocco trip, as I received them as a gift. It was a very special first brew, from the anticipation of grinding and brewing the medium dark roast beans I roasted myself at a coffee farm in Chiang Mai, Thailand, back in January 2024. The Chestnut C2 hand grinder is super fun to use. It&rsquo;s incredibly satisfying to feel the beans releasing their aroma as you grind them - an aromatic journey that took only 30 seconds.</p>
<p>The AeroPress itself is also a fascinating product. Its ease of use and straightforward cleaning process impressed me, making the brewing ritual both enjoyable and hassle-free. The best part is both products have such compact design that I could see myself taking them with me on my trips in the future.</p>
<p>Noting down the recipe I used this time for future reference &amp; improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beans:
<ul>
<li>Shakiso Tero (dark roast)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grind:
<ul>
<li>15g for 250g water (half of my grinder’s capacity)</li>
<li>Coarser grind (20 clicks counterclockwise)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brew:
<ul>
<li>Upright Aeropress setup</li>
<li>Stir for about 30 seconds</li>
<li>Wait for coffee extraction for about 3 minutes (this might be why my brew had a deeper, more bitter taste - can try 2 minutes next time)</li>
<li>1.5 cups of coffee (top-up pour twice)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taste:
<ul>
<li>Slightly bitter and just a tad acidic</li>
<li>Very smooth and aromatic</li>
<li>Thin texture and easy to drink</li>
<li>Sweet and chocolatey aftertaste</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
